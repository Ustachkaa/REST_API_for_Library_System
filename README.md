# REST_API_for_Library_System
This is a comprehensive REST API design for a Library Management System that enables librarians to manage books, users to borrow and return materials, track due dates, handle reservations with queue management, and process fines. The system includes automated scheduling for overdue checks, due date reminders, and notification delivery.
